This extension is deprecated in favor of Visual Studio 2017 which has built-in support for almost all the features this extension provides.

This extension provides additional outlining with syntax highlighted hint for Visual Basic .NET and C#; therefore we can collapse the blocks/scopes such as IF, ELSE, USING, WITH, WHILE, FOREACH and you name it.

Unlike the [C# Outline extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/9390e08c-d0aa-42f1-b3d2-5134aabf3b9a), which replaces the outlining provided by Visual Studio, this extension keeps it untouched, as a result the syntax highlighting remains unchanged.
