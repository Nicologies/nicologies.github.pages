This is an Early Access Preview of the coming official GitExtensions release 

Please don't submit any issue to the official team as it's a MOD version. You can report issues [Here](https://github.com/EbenZhang/gitextensions/issues/new) if you have any concern. 

If you want to contribute a fix or feature, please make sure your branch is based on the official master branch, so it can be merged to both official and this MOD.
