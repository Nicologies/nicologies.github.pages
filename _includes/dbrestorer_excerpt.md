Dbrestorer is a simple utility for restoring SQLServer database from the backup file.

In compare to SQLServer Mangement Studio, DbRestorer is much easier to use because basically all you need is just to drag the backup file in to the window; Moreover, it also provides the ability to customise the database name and the path to where you want to relocate the mdf and ldf files.
