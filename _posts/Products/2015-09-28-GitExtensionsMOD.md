Most of the features have already been merged into the official GitExtensions repository but some of them (e.g. Left branch tree panel) haven't been released yet. You can treat this one as the EAP (Early Access Preview) version of the next major release of the official GitExtensions.

The latest installer can be downloaded from [Here](https://github.com/EbenZhang/gitextensions/releases/latest).
