When using the VSCode extension Debugger for Firefox, your breakpoint might be marked as `Unverified Breakpoint` thus no effect. This happened when I was debugging a webpacked React website, and I mangaged to solve this issue with the help from [here](https://github.com/hbenl/vscode-firefox-debug/issues/57#issuecomment-355769159).
